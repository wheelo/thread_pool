global list of futures
only create threads in thread_pool_new

future {
    void *data
    // L index, R index
}

don't need lock for creating threadpool

point of having separate lists - don't want to contend with the same lock
    - might as well have the same list if that

all lists need locks

2 sep loops so that don't try to steal from uninitialized list

initialize locks? then spawn all them

when to join: flag for shutdown true
    - don't just

threads: check is there work to do?
