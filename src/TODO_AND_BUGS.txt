// TODO

(x) Must remove worker thread from workers_list prior to pthread_exit and/or worker_free()


(x) Try without exiting in error exit


(X) Take out remove calling_worker

(X) pthread_join vs. pthread_join_c
(X) worker_fn() logic wrapped in while(true)

 Top of worker_function()

	removed lines:
	        remove_calling_thread_from_workers_list(pool);
            decrement_num_workers(pool);

	 while (true) {
        // check if threadpool has been shutdown
        if (is_shutting_down(pool)) {
            #ifdef DEBUG 
            fprintf(stdout, "[Thread ID: %lu] in %s(): in while(true) shutdown; Num_workers after exit will be %d\n",
                            (unsigned long)pthread_self(), "worker_function", get_number_of_workers(pool));
            #endif
            remove_calling_thread_from_workers_list(pool);
            decrement_num_workers(pool);
            /* TODO: remove worker from workers list before it exits */
            /* TODO: free_worker(worker); */
            pthread_exit(NULL);
        }
        

(X) Take out workers_list_lock

(x) Make mutex_lock --> mutex_trylock
(x) Make sem_wait --> sem_trywait


( ) if unable to steal, sleep
    ( ) semaphores

    ( ) NEED TO WRAP SEM_POST IN LOOP?

( ) mutex/sem in worker need to be init'd after pthread_create?
( ) same w/ sems for future?


( ) add back to end of worker function
        /*
        if (pool->shutdown_requested) {   // in while loop?
            pthread_mutex_unlock_c(&pool->tasks_available_lock); // change
            pthread_exit(NULL);
        }
        */

(X) Removed both worker_free()

( ) pool_and_worker
	now worker passed, and worker has a ptr to pool

// POSSIBLE BUGS
