## 2 Thread Pools
[Thread Pool Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool_pattern)

###2.1 Work Stealing
####Order that a thread looks for tasks:
1. In its local dequeue  
    * Pop from top of stack
2. From top of global deque (submission queue)
    * tasks are added to <i>top</i> of submission queue
3. Steal from other threads' local deque  
    * from <i>bottom</i> of their lists

###2.2 Helping
#### future_get()
Instead, worker threads that attempt to resolve a future that has not yet computed must help in their execution. For instance, if the futureâ€™s task has not yet started executing, the worker could steal it and execute it itself. If it has started executing, the worker has a number of choices: it could wait for it to finish, or it could help executing tasks spawned by the task being joined, hoping to speed up its completion.

worker threads should not attempt to help by stealing tasks who, in order to complete, rely on the results of tasks whose execution has already been started by the current worker

However, helping must be done carefully: worker threads should not attempt to help by stealing tasks who, in order to complete, rely on the results of tasks whose execution has already been started by the current worker. This can happen if the current worker thread started a task but has not yet completed it because it may be in the middle of joining a task it has spawned. To avoid that, you could adopt a technique such as <b>leap frogging</b> [4], which keeps track of the depth of each task in the computation graph and provides a rule that allows or disallow stealing.

##### Leap Frogging


##### Fully-strict computations

For the purposes of this assignment, we assume a fully-strict model. A fully-strict model requires that tasks join tasks they spawn (in order words, every call to submit a task has a matching call to future get() within the same function invocation.) All our tests will be fully strict computations.


### 2.3 Implementation

You will need to design a synchronization strategy to protect the data structures you use, such as:
* flags representing the execution state of each tasks,
* " " the local queues,
* " " the global submission queue (GSQ)
* others: ...
